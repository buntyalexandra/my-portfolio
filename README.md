## My (Alex Bunty) Portfolio Website

Hello and thank you for taking a look at my codebase for my portfolio website! The website is currently in development. I am having a fabulous time working with Next.js to create and Tailwind to style my funky portfolio site that showcases my web development projects and other creative work including graphic design & digital illustration, multi-media print illustration, and custom cakes.

### Design and Creative Assets

All done by me! The unconventional layout and mixture of still life images and illustrations is meant to give the feel of a digital zine. The color story is inspired by the Breeder's [Last Splash album cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/TheBreedersLastSplash.jpg) (and I just had to throw some pink in there).

Current Tech Stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
